# Obsidian Colored Text Plugin

This is a plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for adding colored texts to your notes.

## Features

- There are slots for storing colors which can be in the status bar. By default, the number of slots is set to 5, but it can be adjusted to any value between 1 and 20 in the settings.
- You can switch between slots, either by using hotkeys or by clicking on color slots
- You can change the current slot's color by opening the color input menu, by using the hotkey, or by clicking the desired color cell in the status bar
- In the input menu, there are two ways to select colors. You can either select from your favorite colors, which is set to the most used colors by default and can be customized in the settings, or you can select a customized color by using the color palette
- You can change the color of the selected text into the current slot's color by using the assigned hotkey or right-clicking
- You can remove the color of the selected text by using the assigned hotkey or right-clicking
- Highlight mode is added, you can activate it through the highlight icon in the status bar or assign a hotkey

## Usage

Right now there are 5 commands available:
- Change the color of the selected text
- Remove the color of the selected text
- Switch between slots, forward
- Switch between slots, backwards
- Open the color input menu

I suggest using hotkeys for these commands as I designed this plugin with a keyboard-centric approach.

## Maintenance Notice
**Note:** As of **October 2025**, this plugin has entered **maintenance mode**.

I've been maintaning it for about 2.5 years, and while it has reached a stable and reliable state, I no longer have the motivation or time to continue active development.

The plugin will remain available and functional, and I’ll do my best to review critical bug reports or pull requests when possible.

**Community contributions are welcome!**
